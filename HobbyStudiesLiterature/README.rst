Learning Sciences
===========

Interest
---------

In learning sciences, hobbies are regarded as "interest-driven practices" involving learning domain-specific knowledge in out-of-school settings. This nature of interest-drivenness is attractive to learning scientists willing to design learner-centered learning environments.

Leisure Studies
==========

Serious Leisure Perspective
-------------------------------

Robert A. Stebbins is a pioneer sociologist who developed a perspective for capturing seriousness in hobbies. From the Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP), we can recognize distinctive nature of hobbies from more casual leisure. The influence SLP spreads beyond sociology of leisure to other disciplines including psychology and learning sciences.
