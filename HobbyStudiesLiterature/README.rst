Learning Sciences
===========

Interest
---------

In learning sciences, hobbies are regarded as "interest-driven practices" involving learning domain-specific knowledge in out-of-school settings. This nature of interest-drivenness is attractive to learning scientists willing to design learner-centered learning environments.

Connected Learning
-----------------------

Connected Learning is a framework for design of  learning environments  developed by Mizuko Ito and her colleagues. It features peer-supported, interest-powered, and academically oriented contexts for learning, which bridging youths' hobbies to their career developments.

Making and Makerspaces
----------------------------

Maker movement in education leverages hobbyists' passion and culture for making and crafting to design creative learning environments. Its theoretical background is Constructionism developed by Seymour Papert, which features problem-solving through making objects, and iterative design process of debugging and tinkering.

Information Science
=============

Information Behavior
------------------------

Avid hobbyists collect, organize, and exchange substantive amount of  information about their interests. This is a unique way of everyday information behavior.

Leisure Studies
==========

Serious Leisure Perspective
-------------------------------

Robert A. Stebbins is a pioneer sociologist who developed a perspective for capturing seriousness in hobbies. From the Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP), we can recognize distinctive nature of hobbies from more casual leisure. The influence SLP spreads beyond sociology of leisure to other disciplines including psychology and learning sciences.

Psychology

Positive Psychology
----------------------

Engaging in leisure activities is seen to enhance positive psychological states such as subjective well-being (SWB). Especially, involvement in serious leisure provides opportunities for mastery and meanings of life which are factors mediating SWB.
