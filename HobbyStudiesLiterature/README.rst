Learning Sciences
===========

Interest
---------

In learning sciences, hobbies are regarded as "interest-driven practices" involving learning domain-specific knowledge in out-of-school settings. This nature of interest-drivenness is attractive to learning scientists willing to design learner-centered learning environments.

Information Behavior
------------------------

From the Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP), we can recognize distinctive nature of hobbies from more casual leisure. The influence SLP spreads beyond sociology of leisure to other disciplines including psychology and learning sciences.

Positive Psychology

Engaging in leisure activities is seen to enhance positive psychological states such as subjective well-being (SWB). Especially, involvement in serious leisure provides opportunities for mastery and meanings of life which are factors mediating SWB.
